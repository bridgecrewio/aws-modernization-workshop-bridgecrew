Infrastructure as code (IaC) frameworks such as AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi make cloud provisioning simple and scalable by leveraging automation and code. Defining your cloud infrastructure in code simplifies repetitive DevOps tasks and gives you a single source of truth for your app and environment configuration.
AWS CloudFormation enables you to define your AWS infrastructure with templates, which you can check into version control or store in S3 buckets.</description></item></channel></rss>
