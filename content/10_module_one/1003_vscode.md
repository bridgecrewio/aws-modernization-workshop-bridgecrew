## Visual Studio Code extension

The Bridgecrew CLI can be used for a quick local scan, but is better suited when automated into a CI/CD pipeline, which we'll dive into in Module Two.

For more developer-friendly local scanning, Bridgecrew's Checkov VS Code extension shows scan results directly at the point of code, without having to constantly re-run the CLI tool. Results and suggested fixes are annotated directly onto the specific code block causing the violation in real-time.
