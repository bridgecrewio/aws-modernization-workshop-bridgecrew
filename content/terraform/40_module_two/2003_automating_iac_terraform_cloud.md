There are two options to detect drift. You can either add the integration with Terraform Cloud or tag your resources with Yor. These don't conflict with each other so you can add both.

A new, native integration between Bridgecrew and Terraform Cloud called Run Tasks is coming soon! Check out the HashiCorp keynote for a preview: https://youtu.be/ZzLZaWUve4M?t=1387

## Leveraging Terraform Cloud and Sentinel for Bridgecrew scans

Bridgecrew has a native integration with Terraform Cloud that leverages Sentinel for policy controls. This means any commit that is pushed to Terraform Cloud will run through a Bridgecrew scan, identifying policy violations, blocking misconfigured builds, and detecting drift, all from the same place that you collaborate on Terraform templates, automate deployments, and store state.

Sentinel is a paid add-on. If you want to try this out for free, HashiCorp does offer a free trial. If you prefer not to sign up for the trial, feel free to skip this section and the "drift detection" section.

To sign up for the free trial of Terraform Cloud’s Team & Governance plan, go to your Terraform Cloud instance. In the top navigation, select “Settings” and “Plan & Billing.” Choose the "Trial Plan" option. You should see Policies and Policy Sets show up in the left navigation menu.

You need to add your TerraGoat repository to Terraform Cloud. Go to “Workspaces” and select “Create one now.”

![Terraform Cloud new workspace](images/terraform_cloud_new_workspace.png "Terraform Cloud new workspace")

Select “Version control workflow”:

![Create a version control workflow](images/terraform_cloud_create_workspace.png "Create a version control workflow")

Select “GitHub," then "github.com," authorize access, and choose your TerraGoat repository we previously forked:

![Add GitHub](images/terraform_cloud_add_github.png "Add GitHub")

Name the workspace `terragoat` and open the “Advanced options” and add the directory `/terraform/simple_instance/` (we'll be adding that directory later). This will focus the scans to just the aws templates. Turn on "Automatic speculative plans" to create plans for pull requests. Select “Create workspace”:

![Config settings](images/terraform_cloud_config_settings.png "Config settings")

Select “Configure variables” and under "Workspace variables" add your AWS Account and Access Keys as environment variables called `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. If you are at an AWS event and using Event Engine, include your `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. If you aren’t sure where to find the keys, see [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

![Add environment variables](images/terraform_cloud_env_variables.png "Add environment variables")

For Event Engine, it will look like this:

![Add environment variables](images/terraform_cloud_env_variables_ee.png "Add environment variables")

Go to the Workspace Settings and select General. From this settings screen, grab your workspace ID for the next step.

![Grab your workspace ID](images/terraform_cloud_workspace_id.png "Grab your workspace ID")

Grab the API token from Terraform Cloud for the integration. Go to the [API token menu](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens) (User -> Settings -> Tokens) and select “Create an API token.”

![Terraform Cloud API token](images/terraform_cloud_api_token.png "Terraform Cloud API token")

Copy that API token for the next step.

Next, you’ll add the Bridgecrew integration. Head over to the [Integrations](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/integrations) screen in the Bridgecrew platform. Scroll down and select Terraform Cloud (Sentinel). Enter the token name `tfc` and choose "Create." You don't need to copy that key for this workshop. Paste your "Workspace ID," "terragoat," "TerraGoat," and the API key from Terraform Cloud. Then click "Next."

![Add TFC details to Bridgecrew](images/bc_tfc_details.png "Add TFC details to Bridgecrew")

Normally, you would add a new repo with the Sentinel policies, but for the purpose of this workshop, we're going to simplify this flow. You can click "Next" on the "Create 'sentinel.hcl'" step.

Copy the 'bridgecrew.sentinel' code and click "Next" in the wizard, then "Done." Head back to Terraform Cloud. Go to Settings in the top nav and select “Policy Sets” and “Connect a new policy set”. You can create a versioned policy set, but for the sake of this workshop, go with "No VCS connection.". Name your setting `terragoat_set` and choose the `terragoat` workspace and select “Connect policy set”.

![Connect the policy set](images/terraform_cloud_connect_policy_set.png "Connect the policy set")

Then, select "Policies." Click on "Create a new policy." Name the policy `bridgecrew`. The "Enforcement mode" will determine whether builds are blocked (`hard-mandatory`) by violations of Sentinel policies, in this case sourced from Bridgecrew, are blocked but with an override (`soft-mandatory`), or just provide the violations but don't block. For the purpose of this workshop, we know there are violations but we want to deploy them anyway. Set the mode to `advisory (logging only)`.

Paste the code you copied in the Bridgecrew integration page and paste it into the “Policy code” section. Under "Policy Sets," choose `terragoat_set` from the drop down, then "Add policy set" and select “Create policy”:

![Add Sentinel Policy](images/sentinel_policy.png "Add Sentinel Policy")

![Policy sets](images/terraform_cloud_policy_sets.png "Policy sets")

Finally, go to your workspace's main page and under "Actions" select "Start new plan"; don't worry if it fails, this just primes the runs to be automated with future GitHub pull requests.
