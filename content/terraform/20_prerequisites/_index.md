Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites. To get the most out of this tutorial, it will also be helpful to have a basic understanding of git, Terraform, AWS core concepts (IAM, regions, UI, CLI, APIs), and CI/CD principles.


### GitHub account

If you don’t have a GitHub account, please [sign up for one here](https://github.com/join).

### Git
```
git --version
```
If you don’t have git installed, [do so here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/).

{{% notice info %}}
If you are using an Amazon-provided AWS account, you do not need to install git locally, as it will already be installed in the Cloud9 IDE environment which has been set up for you.
