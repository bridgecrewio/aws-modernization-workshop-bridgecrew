# CONCLUSION

In this workshop, we didn’t just learn how to identify and automate fixing misconfigurations — we learned how to bridge the gap between infrastructure development, DevOps, and cloud security. We are now equipped with full visibility, guardrails, and remediation capabilities across the development lifecycle. We also learned how important and easy it is to make security accessible to our engineering teams.

Try more of the integrations with other popular developer and DevOps tools. Share what you’ve found with other members of your team and show how easy it is to incorporate this into their development processes. This will show how we can collaborate on the same security dashboard from the **[User Management](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/settings/userManagement?utm_source=awsworkshop)** [page](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/settings/userManagement).
