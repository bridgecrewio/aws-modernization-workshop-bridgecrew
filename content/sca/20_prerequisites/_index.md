Before we don our shiny new black fedora (or our Mr Robot black hoodie, your choice!), we will check the workshop prerequisites and set up the scenario in our AWS account.

The workshop environment setup is heavily automated, so we just need to provide a few specifics to make your environment unique from others attending the same workshop! 

We will need:

- An AWS account to run the workshop (a personal account or one provided via AWS Event Engine for AWS events)
- [A Bridgecrew Account](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/login/signUp)
- The automation to set up our Bank IT environment (which will be provided next)
