As we’ve shown so far, Bridgecrew provides the policies and workflow to audit your CloudFormation templates before deployment, and optionally, to block vulnerabilities from making their way to your deployment pipeline.

In this module, we’ll head back to the Bridgecrew platform to show how easy it can be to improve your cloud security posture with easy-to-understand visualizations and automated remediations. 


## Module Learning Objectives
