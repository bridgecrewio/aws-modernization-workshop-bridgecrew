# Welcome!

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevSecOps to automate, scale, and improve the security posture of your cloud infrastructure. We’ll create a pipeline that provides frequent, easy-to-digest improvements to ensure our configurations are secure and compliant from the build-time to runtime.

Using **Bridgecrew, Checkov, VS Code, GitHub, Kubernetes, ArgoCD** and **AWS**, we’ll get hands-on experience implementing an automated **Kubernetes** security and compliance workflow.

## Learning Objectives
- Get an overview of DevSecOps and Kubernetes infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Scan IaC files for misconfigurations locally
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate security scanning and policy enforcement
- Fix IaC security errors and AWS resource misconfigurations with Bridgecrew

**Let’s start with a few core concepts!**
