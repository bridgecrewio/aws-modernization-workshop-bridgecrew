## Vulnerable-by-design demo repository setup

This workshop uses our vulnerable-by-design Terraform project, [TerraGoat](www.github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat), so that you can scan and automate infrastructure code without the added friction of integrating your own code.

### Fork the TerraGoat repository on GitHub

To set up your demo environment, we're going to fork the TerraGoat repository.

Head over to the [TerraGoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat) repository and fork it using the button in the upper right corner.

If you have multiple organizations, GitHub will ask which of your orgs to fork into. Choose your personal account via your username in the list to fork the repo.
