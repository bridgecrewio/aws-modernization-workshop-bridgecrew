1. If you don't already have an Azure account with Administrator access: [create one now by clicking here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

1. From your local terminal, make sure to install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) and log in with `az login`

1. We need a [service principle](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs/guides/service_principal_configuration) account for part of this workshop. Check that you are logged in as an AD user with administrator access to the Azure account: [View permissions for your user](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).

1. From your terminal run `az account list` to list your connected accounts. Grab your `id` from that output and set your subscription with `az account set --subscription="<your_subscription_id>"`.

1. Generate a Service Principle with `az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<your_subscription_id>"`. Save the output for later steps in the workshop.
