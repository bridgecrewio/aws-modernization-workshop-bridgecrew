### Checkov

In this tutorial, we’re also going to use [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io). Checkov works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can install it with pip:

```bash
pip3 install checkov
```

If installing globally on your system (not in a python venv or pipenv) you may need to have permissions to write the libraries to the necessary locations, ie:

```bash
sudo pip3 install checkov
```

If you run into problems, try the [alternate install instructions](https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/ingesting-scan-data#installation).


### Bridgecrew API token

Throughout the tutorial, you’ll need to use a Bridgecrew API token. You can create one [here](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/integrations/api-token) or in your Bridgecrew account by navigating to the Integrations tab and selecting API Token. Add a token for the workshop and make sure to copy it before closing out.

We'll use the API token in a few places with the environment variable `YOUR_BC_API_KEY`. To make following along easier, set this variable to equal your API token using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
YOUR_BC_API_KEY=<paste-bc-api-key-here>
```
