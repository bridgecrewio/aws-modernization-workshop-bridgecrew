## Investigating security violations in Bridgecrew

Providing feedback in IDEs and CI/CD pipelines provides valuable insights into the posture of your code. Bridgecrew provides a centralized view for tracking misconfigurations across your code scans and runtime environments. Weâ€™ll start with the view across code scans.

Navigate to the [Projects](https://www.bridgecrew.cloud/projects) tab in the Bridgecrew platform. Here you can see the results of your GitHub scan, as well as any other code scan that includes a repository ID and your Bridgecrew API.

This page comes packed with information and navigation tools for misconfigurations identified. 

* Use the filters on the left to narrow down violations, or the top to narrow down to previous git modifiers.
* Search for code snippets or tags in the top. 
* See dependent resources and audit histories on the right side.
