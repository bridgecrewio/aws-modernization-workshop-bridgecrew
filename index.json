The foundation of DevSecOps lies in the DevOps movement, wherein development and operations functions have merged to make deployments faster, safer, and more repeatable. Common DevOps practices include automated infrastructure build pipelines (CI/CD) and version-controlled manifests (GitOps) to make it easier to control cloud deployments. By baking software and infrastructure quality requirements into the release lifecycle, teams save time manually reviewing code, allowing them to focus more on shipping features.\nAs deployments to production speed up, however, many traditional cloud security concepts break down. With the rise of containerized technologies, serverless functions, and IaC frameworks (which we’ll dig into in the next section), it’s harder to maintain cloud security posture visibility.\nBy leveraging DevOps foundations, security and development teams can build security scanning and policy enforcement into automated pipelines. The ultimate goal with DevSecOps is to “shift cloud security left.” That means automating it and embedding it earlier into the development lifecycle so that actions can be taken earlier. Preventing risky deployments is a more proactive approach to traditional cloud security that often slows down development teams with deployment rollbacks and disruptive fixes.\nFor DevSecOps to be successful for teams working to build and secure infrastructure, embracing existing tools and workflows is critical. At Bridgecrew, we’re committed to making it as simple, effective, and painless as possible to automate cloud security and integrate it seamlessly into release lifecycles.\nThe examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various Bridgecrew and AWS services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples, especially the intentionally vulnerable \"CFNGoat\" repository, are not intended for use in production environments.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) frameworks such as AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi make cloud provisioning simple and scalable by leveraging automation and code. Defining your cloud infrastructure in code simplifies repetitive DevOps tasks and gives you a single source of truth for your app and environment configuration.\nAWS CloudFormation enables you to define your AWS infrastructure with templates, which you can check into version control or store in S3 buckets. CloudFormation templates are JSON or YAML files. For instance, the following template defines an S3 bucket:\n{ \u0026#34;AWSTemplateFormatVersion\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2010-09-09\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;AWS CloudFormation Sample Template: Sample template showing how to create a publicly accessible S3 bucket.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resources\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;S3Bucket\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;AWS::S3::Bucket\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Properties\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;AccessControl\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;PublicRead\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WebsiteConfiguration\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;IndexDocument\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;index.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ErrorDocument\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;error.html\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;DeletionPolicy\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Retain\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;Outputs\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;WebsiteURL\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Fn::GetAtt\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;S3Bucket\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WebsiteURL\u0026#34; ] }, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;URL for website hosted on S3\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;S3BucketSecureURL\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Fn::Join\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, [ \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34;, { \u0026#34;Fn::GetAtt\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;S3Bucket\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DomainName\u0026#34; ] } ] ] }, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Name of S3 bucket to hold website content\u0026#34; } } } Using the AWS CLI, you can provision the above bucket in seconds: (This is an example, not required for the workshop)\naws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name myexamplestack --template-body file:///home/example/mytemplate.json Security and CloudFormation IaC The benefit of using CloudFormation to define your AWS infrastructure is that it allows you to audit templates before they’re deployed. That will enable you to bake security best practices into your development and deployment lifecycle and finding potential security and compliance issues before the infrastructure becomes real.\nCloudFormation gives us total control to create, change, and delete resources in AWS. With CloudFormation, it’s easy to pick and deploy any of the hundreds of templates readily available from the AWS sample templates. Because these templates are built solely with functionality in mind, it’s also easy to forget important security configuration and end up having an insecure service running in production.\nThat’s why scanning your CloudFormation templates for vulnerable infrastructure before deployment is so important. With Bridgecrew, you can automate the scanning of your IaC codebase and cloud resources to both find and fix misconfigurations.\nIn this workshop, we’re doing exactly that. So let’s get started!\n"},{"uri":"/6_prerequisites.html","title":"Prerequisites","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites.
