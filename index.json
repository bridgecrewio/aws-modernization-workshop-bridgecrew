In this workshop, you’ll learn how to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevSecOps to automate your cloud security efforts.

The foundation of DevSecOps lies in the DevOps movement, wherein development and operations functions have merged to make deployments faster, safer, and more repeatable. Common DevOps practices include automated infrastructure build pipelines (CI/CD) and version-controlled manifests (GitOps) to make it easier to control cloud deployments. By baking software and infrastructure quality requirements into the release lifecycle, teams save time manually reviewing code, allowing them to focus more on shipping features.\nAs deployments to production speed up, however, many traditional cloud security concepts break down. With the rise of containerized technologies, serverless functions, and IaC frameworks (which we’ll dig into in the next section), it’s harder to maintain cloud security posture visibility.\nBy leveraging DevOps foundations, security and development teams can build security scanning and policy enforcement into automated pipelines. The ultimate goal with DevSecOps is to “shift cloud security left.” That means automating it and embedding it earlier into the development lifecycle so that actions can be taken earlier. Preventing risky deployments is a more proactive approach to traditional cloud security that often slows down development teams with deployment rollbacks and disruptive fixes.\nFor DevSecOps to be successful for teams working to build and secure infrastructure, embracing existing tools and workflows is critical. At Bridgecrew, we’re committed to making it as simple, effective, and painless as possible to automate cloud security and integrate it seamlessly into release lifecycles.\nThe examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various Bridgecrew and AWS services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples, especially the intentionally vulnerable \"CFNGoat\" repository, are not intended for use in production environments.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) frameworks such as AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi make cloud provisioning simple and scalable by leveraging automation and code. Defining your cloud infrastructure in code simplifies repetitive DevOps tasks and gives you a single source of truth for your app and environment configuration.\nAWS CloudFormation enables you to define your AWS infrastructure with templates, which you can check into version control or store in S3 buckets. CloudFormation templates are JSON or YAML files. For instance, the following template defines an S3 bucket:\n{ \u0026#34;AWSTemplateFormatVersion\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2010-09-09\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;AWS CloudFormation Sample Template: Sample template showing how to create a publicly accessible S3 bucket.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resources\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;S3Bucket\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;AWS::S3::Bucket\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Properties\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;AccessControl\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;PublicRead\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WebsiteConfiguration\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;IndexDocument\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;index.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ErrorDocument\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;error.html\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;DeletionPolicy\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Retain\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;Outputs\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;WebsiteURL\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Fn::GetAtt\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;S3Bucket\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WebsiteURL\u0026#34; ] }, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;URL for website hosted on S3\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;S3BucketSecureURL\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;Fn::Join\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, [ \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34;, { \u0026#34;Fn::GetAtt\u0026#34; : [ \u0026#34;S3Bucket\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DomainName\u0026#34; ] } ] ] }, \u0026#34;Description\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Name of S3 bucket to hold website content\u0026#34; } } } Using the AWS CLI, you can provision the above bucket in seconds: (This is an example, not required for the workshop)\naws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name myexamplestack --template-body file:///home/example/mytemplate.json Security and CloudFormation IaC The benefit of using CloudFormation to define your AWS infrastructure is that it allows you to audit templates before they’re deployed. That will enable you to bake security best practices into your development and deployment lifecycle and finding potential security and compliance issues before the infrastructure becomes real.\nCloudFormation gives us total control to create, change, and delete resources in AWS. With CloudFormation, it’s easy to pick and deploy any of the hundreds of templates readily available from the AWS sample templates. Because these templates are built solely with functionality in mind, it’s also easy to forget important security configuration and end up having an insecure service running in production.\nThat’s why scanning your CloudFormation templates for vulnerable infrastructure before deployment is so important. With Bridgecrew, you can automate the scanning of your IaC codebase and cloud resources to both find and fix misconfigurations.\nIn this workshop, we’re doing exactly that. So let’s get started!\n"},{"uri":"/6_prerequisites.html","title":"Prerequisites","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites.

You’ve just automated security scanning of your infrastructure as code into a developer-friendly CI/CD pipeline.\nIn the next module, we’ll look at how to investigate and fix the issues arising from the automated scans, as well as providing more tips for integrating security into the developer workflow without causing friction.\n"},{"uri":"/30_module_three.html","title":"Module - Fix","tags":[],"description":"","content":" As we’ve shown so far, Bridgecrew provides the policies and workflow to audit your CloudFormation templates before deployment, and optionally, to block vulnerabilities from making their way to your deployment pipeline.\nIn this module, we’ll head back to the Bridgecrew platform to show how easy it can be to improve your cloud security posture with easy-to-understand visualizations and automated remediations.\nModule Learning Objectives  Investigating security violations in Bridgecrew Integrating Bridgecrew with GitHub Automating pull requests with GitHub Scanning runtime resources for vulnerable infrastructure  "},{"uri":"/30_module_three/3001_bridgecrew_dashboard_results.html","title":"Bridgecrew platform results","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Investigating security violations in Bridgecrew While the output from your CodeBuild run is very useful for quickly getting a sense of why your build failed, you may also want to visualize issues over time with a given repository or group objects affected by the same issue for clearer understanding.\nIf your developers don’t have direct access to the AWS account, the provided logs may be constrained.\nFor all those reasons and more, Bridgecrew provides reporting, monitoring, alerting, and visualizations for individual runs and across your entire infrastructure.\nHeading back to Bridgecrew, you’ll notice, our AWS CodeBuild integration has gone green showing that we’ve received data.

To help you implement fixes as fast as possible, Bridgecrew generates and pushes fix pull requests back into your GitHub repository.\nLet’s walk through the process with one of the policies we looked at earlier, Ensure S3 bucket has ‘restrict_public_bucket’ enabled:\nWhen we click on one of the GitHub-integrated violations, \u0026lt;yourgithubusername\u0026gt;/cfngoat: Bucket.FinancialsBucket, for example, we’ll see the platform recommending an automated fix in the form of a code diff:\nCheck out the Guidelines tab for more information on the policy and if you’are satisfied with the proposed fix, you can tick the box next to the resource name above the diff, and select Remediate.\nThe remediation modal shows there will be a pull request fix raised against your GitHub repository.\nAfter you select Remediate, you’ll be taken back to the Incidents screen with a message confirming the pull request has been successfully raised. You’ll also see the remediation has had the effect of hiding the issue from the Incidents list; other resources are listed, but the one we addressed is gone.\nYou’ll also notice, however, that the issue is still present from our CodePipeline source, so we’re not secure yet!\nOver in our CfnGoat repository in GitHub, we’ll see a new PR under the Pull requests tab, which is ready for review:\nDigging into the changed files, you’ll see the updated code that will soon be merged.\nBringing it all together. Merging our pull request in GitHub triggers our CI/CD deployment in AWS CodePipeline that we previously set up.\nYou may be able to tell where this is going!\nNotice our merged pull request commit has triggered the build:\nOf course, the scan will still fail as there are several other security issues affecting the CfnGoat repository, but if we head back to Bridgecrew, the issue we just fixed is gone:\nNow we know that the issue is not only fixed at source, but also that the fix has also made it through the CI/CD pipeline into production!\nCongratulations!

In reality, our AWS accounts have objects that were created manually for one reason or another. Transitioning to IaC is rarely a one-and-done affair, so you may have objects in your AWS accounts that are managed by a team that has not yet made the switch.\nThat’s why it’s important to scan objects directly in your AWS environment in addition to scanning your CloudFormation or Terraform manifests in git or as part of the CI/CD pipeline, as we’ve already shown.\nBridgecrew provides runtime scanning via an AWS integration, allowing full coverage of infrastructure security both before and after deployment.\nAWS Runtime Integration To enable runtime scanning of your AWS account, goto the Integrations Tab and select AWS Read Only under the Cloud Providers section.\nRead-only access is scoped as minimally as possible in order to give Bridgecrew only the necessary access to scan your AWS accounts.  Click Add Account then Launch Stack to enable the integration:\nYou will be taken to your AWS account to authorize the integration:\nCheck the checkbox to approve the IAM permission creations via our CloudFormation stack, and click Create Stack\nYou can track the progress of the stack creation within your AWS account, once completed, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the integration turn green in the Bridgecrew dashboard!\nSucessful Integration: That’s all it takes to connect your AWS account to Bridgecrew for continuous cloud security monitoring and compliance benchmarking.\nExploring runtime violations With the runtime AWS account connected, let’s edit our filters on the Incidents page to show only the AWS source. In the filters option pane, select your AWS account ID that should now show up alongside your CodePipeline and GitHub repositories from the earlier modules.\nUnlike the rest of this workshop, the information displayed in your Bridgecrew Dashboard may differ from the images below, as no two AWS accounts will have the same content.  After setting our filter, we can browse through all the security and compliance violations detected in our live AWS account,\nIn the example below, we can see an S3 bucket is not encrypted at rest. Selecting a resource from the group of resources on the right hand side will display much more information, including a Terraform representation of the AWS object in question:\nFurther context on the issue and remediation options is also available in the Guidelines tab.\nBridgecrew also alerts on account-wide settings such as user password policies and informational best practices, such as tagging each resource with ownership or purpose information:\nUntagged Items in Account Weak Account Password Policy Identity and Access Management (IAM) Insights Bridgecrew also analyzes AWS IAM roles, permissions, groups, and policies to identify unused and overly-permissive configurations.\nYou can use the filter pane to only show Insights, highlighting IAM specific issues:\nIAM Insights will even provide a re-written, rightsized IAM policy document with only the permissions your applications are requesting of the role or policy.
